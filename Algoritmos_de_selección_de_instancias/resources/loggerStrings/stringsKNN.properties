KNNWrongArgsError =  Wrong input parameter format when launching the \
k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. Error in {0}
KNNWrongArgsValuesError = Check the parameters' values. Remember that:\
\n \t -k must be positive.\
\n \t -numPart must be positive.\
\n \t -numRed must be positive.\
\n \t -numRedPart must be -1 or positive.\
\n \t -maxW must be zero or positive. \
\n \t -nc must be at least 2.\
\n \t -dt must be MANHATTAN = 1 ; EUCLIDEAN = 2 ; HVDM = 3.\
KNNPossibleArgs = Possible arguments are:\
\n \t -k + int \t Number of nearest Neighbors\
\n \t -np + int Number of partitions the training set is divided.\
\n \t -nr + int Number of reduce partitions in the result.\
\n \t -nrp + int Number of reduce partitions for the test dataset.\
\n \t -maxW + double Maximun weight per reduce partition.\ 
\n \t -nc + int Number of classes of the dataset.\
\n \t -dt + int How to measure the distance between two instances.
KNNNoNumberError = I was expecting a number but I got {0}
KNNPairNumberParamError =  I was expecting a pair number of arguments in {0}
