KNNWrongArgsError =  Wrong input parameter format when launching the \
k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. Error in {0}
KNNWrongArgsValuesError = Check the values for -k. Remember that:\
\n \t -k must be positive.
KNNPossibleArgs = Possible arguments are:\
\n \t -k + int \t Number of nearest Neighbors
KNNNoNumberError = I was expecting a number but I got {0}
KNNPairNumberParamError =  I was expecting a pair number of arguments in {0}
