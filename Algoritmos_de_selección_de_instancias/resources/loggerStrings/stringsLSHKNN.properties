LSHKNNWrongArgsError =  Wrong input parameter format when launching the \
LSH k-Nearest Neighbors (LSHKNN) algorithm. Error in {0}
LSHKNNWrongArgsValuesError = Check the parameters' values. Remember that:\
\n \t -k must be positive.\
\n \t -and must be positive.\
\n \t -or must be positive.\
\n \t -w must be positive.\
\n \t -s must be positive.
LSHKNNPossibleArgs = Possible arguments are:\
\n \t -k + int \t Number of nearest neighbors\
\n \t -and + int Number of AND functions to use.\
\n \t -or + int Number of OR functions to use.\
\n \t -w + double Bucket's width.\ 
\n \t -s Seed for the LSH functions.
LSHKNNNoNumberError = I was expecting a number but I got {0}
LSHKNNPairNumberParamError =  I was expecting a pair number of arguments in {0}
